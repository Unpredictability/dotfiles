# Hello
i am using this repo to store my configuration files, using a tool called 
`chezmoi`. As you can see in the filenames, all `.` are changed into `dot_`,
so in order to use these files, you might change the filename by hand or 
use `chezmoi` to manage them for you.

you might interested in my `LuaSnip` +  `LaTeX` config,
see my snippets in [snippets](dot_config/nvim/lua/snippets).
